# Security and Network Engineering Repository

This repository supports the Master's in Security and Network Engineering (SNE), the only academic programme in The Netherlands dedicated to understanding, developing, maintaining, and securing complex IT systems and networks. The program emphasizes hands-on expertise and poses critical questions, such as:

- How do you integrate various software components within a complex architecture to create a safe and efficiently functioning system?

Explore this repository for practical implementations, research materials, and tools relevant to securing and optimizing network systems.

This Master's programme started in 2024 and is expected to end in 2026.

New sections will be added as the courses are completed.
